# CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS

## Overview

  The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning to solve a real world challenge - credit card risk.
  In this analysis, I used imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and 
  evaluate models using resampling. I used the credit card dataset from LendingClub, I was 
  able to oversample the data using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data
  by using ClusterCenteroids algorithms. I also used a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling
  using the SMOTEENN algorithm, then used the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict
  the credit risk.
